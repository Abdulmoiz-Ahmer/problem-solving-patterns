# Valid Palindrome

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return `True` if it is a palindrome, otherwise return `False`.

A phrase is a **palindrome** if:

- It reads the same backward as forward
- After converting all uppercase letters to lowercase
- After removing all non-alphanumeric characters (only letters `a-z` and digits `0-9` are considered)

### Constraints:

- `1 ≤ s.length ≤ 3000`
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.
