# Problem: Reverse Words in a String

## Statement

You are given a string `sentence` that may contain:

Return the resulting modified sentence as a **single string** with:

- Words separated by **a single space**
- **No leading or trailing spaces**

## Note

- A **word** is defined as a **continuous sequence of non-space characters**.
- Multiple words separated by single spaces form a valid English sentence.
- The returned string must have:
  - **Only a single space between any two words**
  - **No leading, trailing, or extra spaces**

---

## Constraints

- The sentence contains **English uppercase and lowercase letters**, **digits**, and **spaces**
- There is **at least one word** in the sentence
- `1 ≤ sentence.length ≤ 10⁴`
