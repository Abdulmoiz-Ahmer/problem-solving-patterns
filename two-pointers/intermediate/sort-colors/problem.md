# Problem: Sort Colors

## Statement

Given an array `colors`, which contains a combination of the following three elements:

- `0` (Representing red)
- `1` (Representing white)
- `2` (Representing blue)

Sort the array **in place** so that the elements of the same color are adjacent, and the final order is:  
**red (0), then white (1), and then blue (2).**

> **Note**:  
> You are **not allowed** to use any built-in sorting functions.  
> The goal is to solve this efficiently without extra space.

---

## Constraints

- `n = colors.length`
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 300`
- `colors[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`
