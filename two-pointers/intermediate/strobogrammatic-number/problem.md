## Problem: Strobogrammatic Number

---

### Statement

Given a string `num` representing an integer, determine whether it is a **strobogrammatic number**.  
Return **TRUE** if the number is strobogrammatic, or **FALSE** if it is not.

---

### Definition

A **strobogrammatic number** appears the same when rotated **180°** (viewed upside down).

**Examples:**

- `"69"` → Strobogrammatic (looks the same upside down)
- `"962"` → Not strobogrammatic

---

### Constraints

- `1 <= num.length <= 50`
- `num` contains **only digits**
- `num` has **no leading zeros** except when the number itself is `"0"`
